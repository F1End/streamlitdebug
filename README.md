# streamlitdebug
This repo is for hosting a sample application for the discussion of ghost/mirage left by streamlit widgets.

Application code is in simple_app.py.
main.py is setup to kick the file off, so it should be enought to just run that file. (only tested for Windows 10 though)

Using python 3.11, but should work on most 3 versions.
